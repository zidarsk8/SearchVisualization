An older project for comparing search efficiency of KD tree and PR tree.

These are both trees used for searching in multiple dimetions, and the visual representation is made in 2D so the diffrences should become bigger as the number of dimetions increases.

PR tree uses some very inefficiently implemented structures, witch should be improved.

TODO: clean up the code a bit, and translate the comments to english.


PS:Some of the code for KD tree is borrowed from a school book.
